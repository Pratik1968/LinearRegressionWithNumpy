# Linear Regression with Numpy
## Introduction:
This repository contains code for implementing a simple linear regression model using the NumPy library in Python. Linear regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This model aims to predict the dependent variable's value based on the independent variables.

## Dependencies:
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your Python environment:

    NumPy
    

You can install them using the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Files in the Repository:

  main.py: This file contains the implementation of the linear regression model using NumPy.
  
  requirements.txt: This file lists all the dependencies required to run the code. Use it to install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
  
  README.md: This file contains basic information about the repository, its contents, and how to use the code.
